APRIL VEGETABLE CALENDAR (string version)

In this kata, you are given an object that contains the vegetable seeds you plant in April
(since it's a great month to start planting summer vegetables!).
The 'vegetable' object contains the name of the vegetable (string) planted in the greenhouse
and the day of the month (number) that each vegetable is planted. For example: {name: "cucumber", day: 15}.

The vegetable seeds must be moved outside exactly three weeks after the seeds are planted.

Write a function 'aprilVeg' that returns:
- A string with the name of the plant, the date it was planted and the date it needs to be moved outside.
For example, if a cucumber is planted on the 15th April, the function should return "The cucumber planted on April 15 needs to be moved outside on May 6."
- A string with the message "Invalid day for the month of April." if the day of the month entered isn't between 1 and 30.
- A string with the message "Empty data." if the object is empty or if the name or day properties are missing.


APRIL VEGETABLE CALENDAR (array version)

If you enjoyed working on the string version of the kata, here's the array version.

Write a function 'aprilVegArrays' that takes an array of objects as a parameter.
The array contains the vegetable objects that you need to process. 
The function should return a new array of strings with the same format as the string version of the kata.
